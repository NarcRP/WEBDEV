    <h1>Probable Cause</h1>
    <p>Must exist for a law enforcement officer to make an arrest without a warrant, search without a warrant, or seize property in the belief the items were evidence of a crime. A lack of probable cause will render a warrantless arrest invalid, and any evidence resulting from that arrest (physical evidence, confessions, etc.) will have to be suppressed. In that case, notwithstanding the lack of probable cause, any (physical evidence, confessions, etc) obtained will be admissible.  This must be witnessed first hand by either you or another officer.</p>
