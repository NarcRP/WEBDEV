<p class="title">Interview Process</p>
<p class="normaltext">Does this sound like something that you would be intersted in? <br> If so then head to our whitelisted jobs link and hvae made a ticket, a member of the police team or one of the staff members will have sent over the link to do your application, applications are required to be detailed and nothing but the truth. Once your application is complete either the chief <strong>O-101 | Callum R.</strong> or <strong>T-102 | Charlie J.</strong> will view the application and get back to you. For people that struggle to complete an application, that is not a problem, there is always the opporunity for you to be given a verbal interview where you are able to give your same ideas and answers by speaking to someone instead of having to fill in an application which can be a struggle for some people.</p>

After you have done the "classroom" training you will move on to field training with Real Police Cars and A setup crimminal scene. Your trial period will be next where you will be placed with another officer and take control, the other officer will be there to set in if needed.
