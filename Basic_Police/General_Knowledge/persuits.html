    <h1>Pursuits:</h1>

    <p>If you become involved in a pursuit then your main priority is always the safety of others, this means that driving on opposite lanes of travel and driving on pavements is not permitted as you are putting the public life at risk.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are Primary in a pursuit then your job is to relay communications to other officers attempting to join the pursuit or keep up with the pursuit.  If a second unit arrives on a pursuit you may ask them to take over communications whilst you focus on keeping up with the suspect.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If a member of traffic enters the pursuit then you must give up primary when requested.</p>
    <br>
    <p>No matter what you must not overtake your fellow officers during a pursuit without clearly announcing yourself over the radio first, when doing this you would say e.g “i am going to be overtaking on your (either left or right) when it is next safe to do so”.  This should only be done when on a straight road and does not endanger the public.</p>
