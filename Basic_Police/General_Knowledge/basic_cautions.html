    <p>You <strong>MUST</strong> know this definition like a poem there is no way around it. You many read people their rights after they have been arrested <strong>OR</strong> before questioning them. Any information that they have verblly said to you is void if you haven't read them there rights. When making an arrest first of all you would state the reason for them been placed under arrest <i>"You are currently under arrest for Failure to stop for poluce under section 28 of the Road Traffic act 1988"</i> once the reason for the arrest is stated then you would read the following caution as follows.</p>
    <br>
    <p><i>You do not have to say anything but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court anything you do say can be given as evidence, do you understand these rights that have been read to you</i></p>
