    <h1>Consensual Encounters</h1>
    <p>This is the most common encounter that a law enforcement officer will encounter whilst on active duty. in which police use no commands, force,blue lights or sirens, but simply approach a person and engage him in conversation and make plain-view observations without any official restraints, and for which no level of justification is needed. This person would be free to leave at any given time.</p>
