    <h1>Etiquette</h1>
    <p>When communicating over the radio the golden rule is <strong>to give As much information as possible in a short period of time,</strong> to do this we recommend you follow the 3 W’s, <strong>What</strong> is happening, <strong>where</strong> it is happening and <strong>who</strong> is involved.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Under no circumstances should you engage in general conversation over the radio, if you wish to have a conversation with someone this must be done in person.</p>
    <br>
    <li>Never talk over each other when on the radio, this ensures proper communication and fluidity of information.</li>
    <li>Ensure that priorities such as pursuits and robberies take priority in radio, meaning that active priorities override small occurrences such as TS(traffic stops).</li>
